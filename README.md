# React Quiz Application

This project is a simple quiz application built with React. It uses a JSON file to store and manage quiz questions. The application fetches the questions from the JSON file, displays them to the user, and keeps track of the user's score using Context and Reducer hooks for state management. This setup makes it easy to update the quiz content by simply modifying the JSON file.
